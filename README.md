# Building and Running the Project
You need `g++` and `make` installed. Use your favourite package manager to do so.

To compile the files, run:
```bash
$ make 
# OR 
$ make client-phase<phase_number>
```

To run the executables:
```bash
$ ./client-phase<phase_number> <path-to-config-file> <path-to-owned-files>
```
